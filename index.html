            <h3>The Secret to Having a Happy Marriage</h3>
            <p>Talking with your spouse is one of the best ways to keep your marriage healthy and successful. Be honest about
                what
                you're feeling, but be kind and respectful when you communicate. Part of good communication is being a good
                listener
                and taking the time to understand what it is your spouse wants and needs from you. Keep the lines of
                communication
                open by talking often, and not just about things like bills and the kids. Share your thoughts and feelings
            </p>
